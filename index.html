<h2>OSS is an important component of a telecom operator's business development.
Management systems are one of the key elements of ensuring business continuity of telecom operators, since it is on them that the uninterrupted provision of services to users depends. Automation of management of modern networks consisting of a large number of elements makes it possible to concentrate on really important events due to a sharp reduction in the volume of incoming information, as a result of which the overall structure of the business support system is simplified.
In total, about 400 manufacturers offer 13 categories of OSS solutions on the world market. There are quite a large number of systems on the Russian market - these are umbrella multifunctional solutions and specialized products for performing individual tasks. Operators face a difficult task - to choose such components so that their combination contributes to the successful achievement of the goal.

If we talk about solutions with broad functionality, the most popular in the world are the OSS solutions of Micromuse companies and â€” to a somewhat lesser extent - Agilent Technologies, Metasolv Software, HP, IBM and Amdocs. All of them are umbrella, but they are used for different sets of functional tasks. However, even with comparable functionality, each has its own competitive advantages. For example, HP offers the best price; Agilent is the leader in reliability and performance; IBM/Tivoli has the best global support and service. If all these parameters are taken into account together, then Micromuse seems to be the optimal solution, especially since in the near future users of this system will be supported by the IBM service department.
Thus, two key factors are essential for the success of OSS implementation and risk minimization:

joint work and coordination of the activities of the integrator and customer specialists;
choosing a supplier who already has real experience of such implementations.

For telecom operators, information systems have become not only a means of production, but also a way to achieve competitive advantages, so they strive to maintain a high technological level of their own systems and ensure their uninterrupted operation. Today, OSS implementation is one of the key factors for the success of the operator's business.</h2>
